✅ Final Assessment Instructions: AI Impact, Modality, and Skill Transition Burden

You are an Assistant tasked with evaluating each SOC-task pairing in a given workflow. For each entry, perform three core assessments as follows:

---

Use “PEP UDP Reference” (repo file) as the capabilities rubric to standardize:
- the %PEP / %UDP split (automatable effort share),
- the Modality label (PEP / UDP / Hybrid) using the 70/30 thresholds (with the JZ≤3 Routine tie-breaker),
- and the Fit (High/Med/Low) judgment.
The reference is an input rubric; it does not auto-score rows.



🧠 1. AI Impact Risk (Do NOT label this as 'Displacement Risk')

     Evaluate the risk that AI will materially alter the way this task is performed within a 10-year period. This may include automation, augmentation, workflow redesign, or quality enhancement—but not necessarily job elimination.
     
     🟡 Assign **AI Impact Risk values using a 1–10 scale** for each time horizon (1–3 yrs, 4–7 yrs, 8–10 yrs).  
     
     📈 The Analyzer will automatically convert these values to a **percentage scale (×10)** for use in Comparor and label assignment.  
     For example:  
     - Score of 6 → 60%  
     - Score of 8 → 80%
     
     This maintains consistent logic across domain scoring and output interpretation.

Use the following scale:

🔵 Very Low – AI may assist but won’t alter task fundamentally.
🟢 Low – AI handles subcomponents; humans still perform core task.
🟡 Moderate – AI alters core workflow but human oversight persists.
🟠 High – Majority of task is transformed via AI (e.g., automated, AI-led decisions).
🔴 Very High – Task can be end-to-end handled by AI; human role becomes exception-only.

### Analyzer AI Risk Scoring Framework (Updated)

AI Impact Risk must be scored across three timeframes: 1–3 years, 4–7 years, and 8–10 years. These reflect the evolving risk that AI will materially transform the role’s core tasks.

1. Start with Base Role Type (Cognitive × Routine Matrix):

| Cognitive? | Routine? | AI Risk (1–3 / 4–7 / 8–10 yrs) |
|------------|----------|-------------------------------|
| Yes        | Yes      | 4 / 6 / 8                     |
| Yes        | No       | 2 / 4 / 6                     |
| No         | Yes      | 4 / 6 / 7                     |
| No         | No       | 1 / 2 / 3                     |

2. Apply AI Modality Adjustment:
- If Modality is **PEP**: +1 to 8–10 yr risk for routine roles
- If Modality is **UDP**: +1 to 4–7 and 8–10 yr bands for document-heavy tasks
- If Hybrid: apply whichever adjustment is higher

Timing prior:
- PEP-majority or PEP-only tasks tend to show earlier near-term impact (1–3 yrs), especially for Routine and JZ ≤ 3.
- UDP-majority and Hybrid tasks tend to ramp more in 4–7 and 8–10 yrs, especially for Non-routine and JZ ≥ 4, or when documents are complex.
Timing prior:
- PEP-only or PEP-majority tasks show earlier 1–3 yr impact, especially for Routine and JZ ≤ 3.
- UDP-majority or Hybrid tasks ramp more in 4–7 and 8–10 yrs, especially for Non-routine and JZ ≥ 4, or where documents are long/complex.



3. Non-Decreasing Rule:
- AI Impact Risk must **not decrease** across time bands.
- If 1–3 yr risk is Very Low (1), 8–10 yr risk must not exceed Moderate (5).

4. Maximum Cap:
- Do not assign scores above 9. If a role is not fully automatable, cap at 8.

5. Job Zone Influence:
- Do NOT use JZ to directly reduce AI risk.
- JZ affects Skill Transition Burden only — not Risk.

6. Structure-Driven Escalation:
- Tasks involving “enter,” “verify,” “route,” “submit,” “extract,” “classify,” “code,” or “scrub” are structurally automatable.
- For such tasks, raise 4–7 and 8–10 yr scores by 1–2 points.

7. Final Validation:
- Apply judgment using domain knowledge and modality context.
- Verify that risk aligns with displacement trajectory, not merely AI support.

✔ Example:  
A Claims Clerk (Cognitive + Routine, UDP Modality):  
→ Base Risk: 4 / 6 / 8  
→ UDP Modality = +1 for 4–7 and 8–10  
→ Final Risk: 4 / 7 / 9

⚙️ 2. AI Modality: PEP, UDP, or Hybrid

Determine referencing PEP and UDP capabilities.pptx whether the AI being applied is best described as:

🧠 PEP (Predictive Exception Processing) – for predictive models, structured pattern recognition, classification, flagging
📄 UDP (Unstructured Data Processing) – for document parsing, text extraction, summarization, semantic comparison
🔁 Hybrid (PEP + UDP) – if both predictive and unstructured techniques are used

🔧 3. Skill Transition Burden (STB)

     Revised Skill Transition Burden (STB) Scoring Logic

     Skill Transition Burden (STB) represents the difficulty current workers will face transitioning into the AI-modified version of their subtask. It is scored independently from AI Risk and is influenced by worker adaptability, role complexity, and the nature of AI intervention.
     
     Use the following rubric:
     
     Start with a base score of 3.
     
     Experience Zone Adjustments:
     - Add +0 if Job Zone = JZ 1 or JZ 2
     - Add +1 if Job Zone = JZ 3
     - Add +2 if Job Zone = JZ 4
     - Add +3 if Job Zone = JZ 5
     
     Cognitive & Routine Adjustments:
     - Add +1 if Cognitive = Yes
     - Add +1 if Routine = No
     
     AI Modality Adjustments:
     - Add +0 if AI Modality = PEP
     - Add +1 if AI Modality = UDP
     - Add +2 if AI Modality = Hybrid
     
     Cap final STB score at 10.
     
     This framework reflects that:
     - Lower JZ roles tend to have simpler, more adaptable tasks
     - Higher JZ roles may require significant retraining to adjust to AI workflows
     - Cognitive, non-routine tasks are more impacted by AI-led transformation
     - Hybrid and UDP modalities introduce greater abstraction or prompt/audit complexity than PEP
     
     STB must remain conceptually distinct from AI Risk and is critical to quadrant classification.
