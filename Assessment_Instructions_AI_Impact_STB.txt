✅ Final Assessment Instructions: AI Impact, Modality, and Skill Transition Burden

You are an Assistant tasked with evaluating each SOC-task pairing in a given workflow. For each entry, perform three core assessments as follows:

---

🧠 1. AI Impact Risk (Do NOT label this as 'Displacement Risk')

Evaluate the risk that AI will materially alter the way this task is performed within a 10-year period. This may include automation, augmentation, workflow redesign, or quality enhancement—but not necessarily job elimination.

Use the following scale:

🔵 Very Low – AI may assist but won’t alter task fundamentally.
🟢 Low – AI handles subcomponents; humans still perform core task.
🟡 Moderate – AI alters core workflow but human oversight persists.
🟠 High – Majority of task is transformed via AI (e.g., automated, AI-led decisions).
🔴 Very High – Task can be end-to-end handled by AI; human role becomes exception-only.

### Analyzer AI Risk Scoring Framework (v10.4)

AI Risk Scores must be assigned for three time periods (1–3, 4–7, 8–10 years) using the following guidance:
 
  - Use domain logic and instructions from `/reference/docs/Assessment_Instructions_AI_Impact_STB.txt`  
  - Score as percentage (0–100%)  

- ✅ 🟩 Assign qualitative labels using the following thresholds:

| Risk Label     | % Range        |
|----------------|----------------|
| Very Low       | 0–10%          |
| Low            | 11–25%         |
| Moderate       | 26–50%         |
| High           | 51–75%         |
| Very High      | 76–100%        |

- ✅ 🟩 Ensure numeric risk values (columns Q, S, U) **align** to these qualitative labels (columns R, T, V)  
  - These must never conflict — each qualitative value must be derived directly from its numeric counterpart  

1. Baseline Determination by Modality Traits:
   - Routine + Cognitive → start at Moderate or High in 1–3 yrs
   - Routine + Manual → start at Low or Moderate
   - Non-routine + Cognitive → typically Very Low or Low in 1–3 yrs, Moderate later
   - Non-routine + Manual → typically Very Low to Low, little change over time

2. Experience Zone Adjustments:
   - EZ 1–2 → add +2
   - EZ 4–5 → subtract −2

3. Structure + AI Automation Keywords:
   - Tasks with “enter,” “verify,” “route,” “extract,” “schedule,” “submit” are considered structurally automatable
   - If also routine + cognitive/manual, elevate scores in 4–7 and 8–10 year bands

4. Risk Persistence and Ceiling Logic:
   - Scores must not decrease over time
   - Very Low in 1–3 yrs → cannot exceed Moderate by 8–10 yrs
   - Do not push all tasks to High or Very High
   - Very High = AI can fully replace task end-to-end by 8–10 yrs

5. Interpersonal Exception Clause:
   - Tasks centered on communication, reassurance, or emotional labor without structured triggers should remain Low or Moderate across all periods

⚙️ 2. AI Modality: PEP, UDP, or Hybrid

Determine referencing PEP and UDP capabilities.pptx whether the AI being applied is best described as:

🧠 PEP (Predictive Exception Processing) – for predictive models, structured pattern recognition, classification, flagging
📄 UDP (Unstructured Data Processing) – for document parsing, text extraction, summarization, semantic comparison
🔁 Hybrid (PEP + UDP) – if both predictive and unstructured techniques are used

---

🔧 3. Skill Transition Burden (STB)

Assess how difficult it will be for current FTEs to adapt to the AI-influenced task. Rate on a 1–10 scale:

1–3 = Light Burden
4–6 = Moderate Burden
7–10 = Heavy Burden

Consider:
- Level of judgment or regulation involved
- Communication intensity
- Familiarity with digital tools or analytics
- Experience Zone (EZ): Entry (EZ 1–2), Intermediate (EZ 3–4), Expert (EZ 5)
