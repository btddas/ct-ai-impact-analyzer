✅ Final Assessment Instructions: AI Impact, Modality, and Skill Transition Burden

You are an Assistant tasked with evaluating each SOC-task pairing in a given workflow. For each entry, perform three core assessments as follows:

---

🧠 1. AI Impact Risk (Do NOT label this as 'Displacement Risk')

Evaluate the risk that AI will materially alter the way this task is performed within a 10-year period. This may include automation, augmentation, workflow redesign, or quality enhancement—but not necessarily job elimination.

Use the following scale:

🔵 Very Low – AI may assist but won’t alter task fundamentally.
🟢 Low – AI handles subcomponents; humans still perform core task.
🟡 Moderate – AI alters core workflow but human oversight persists.
🟠 High – Majority of task is transformed via AI (e.g., automated, AI-led decisions).
🔴 Very High – Task can be end-to-end handled by AI; human role becomes exception-only.

Use cognitive/manual and routine/non-routine attributes to guide baseline susceptibility:

- Routine + Cognitive ⇒ Higher Risk
- Routine + Manual ⇒ Moderate Risk
- Non-routine + Cognitive ⇒ Lower (but growing) Risk
- Non-routine + Manual ⇒ Lower to Moderate Risk

⚙️ 2. AI Modality: PEP, UDP, or Hybrid

Determine whether the AI being applied is best described as:

🧠 PEP (Predictive Exception Processing) – for predictive models, structured pattern recognition, classification, flagging.
📄 UDP (Unstructured Data Processing) – for document parsing, text extraction, summarization, semantic comparison.
🔁 Hybrid (PEP + UDP) – if both predictive and unstructured techniques are used.

Refer to use cases such as:
- UDP: Document summarization, text extraction, multi-doc fusion
- PEP: Denial prediction, fraud detection, exception flagging

🔧 3. Skill Transition Burden (STB)

Assess how difficult it will be for current FTEs to adapt to the AI-influenced task. Rate on a 1–10 scale:

1–3 = Light Burden: Minimal upskilling (e.g., basic clerical roles, EZ 1–2)
4–6 = Moderate Burden: Some retraining, change in workflow (e.g., EZ 3–4)
7–10 = Heavy Burden: Deep reskilling or role transformation (e.g., EZ 5, compliance, clinical review)

Consider:
- Level of judgment or regulation involved
- Communication intensity
- Familiarity with digital tools or analytics
- Experience Zone (EZ): Entry (EZ 1–2), Intermediate (EZ 3–4), Expert (EZ 5)
