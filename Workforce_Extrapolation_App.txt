# Workforce Extrapolation Application – CT AI Impact Analyzer

## Purpose
This application extends Analyzer v4 results by extrapolating workflow-level FTE losses to the full Connecticut workforce, organized two ways:
1. By Job Zone × Cognitive/Routine categories
2. By Industry × Job Zone

Both tables are generated with full row and column totals.

## Inputs
1. data/CT FTE counts by SOC v2.csv  
   - Provides total Connecticut workforce by SOC code.
   - Each SOC is already classified by:
     - Job Zone (1–5, per O*NET)
     - Cognitive vs. Manual
     - Routine vs. Non-Routine
2. data/Top10_Industry_List.csv  
   - Provides workforce counts (CT_FTEs) by top 10 industries + Other.
   - Also includes GDP_CT_Millions for contextual analysis.
3. Analyzer v4 output  
   - Provides workflow-level FTE demand loss values.

## Processing Logic

### Step 1 – Build Table A (Job Zone × Cognitive/Routine)
- Pivot `CT FTE counts by SOC v2.csv` into a 5 × 4 table:
  - Rows: Job Zone 1–5
  - Columns: Cognitive Routine (CR), Cognitive Non-Routine (CNR), Manual Routine (MR), Manual Non-Routine (MNR)
- Fill each cell with sum of CT FTEs in that JZ × category.
- Add row totals and column totals.

### Step 2 – Extrapolate Analyzer Losses Across Table A
- Take workflow-level FTE loss % from Analyzer v4.
- Apply this % proportionally to each JZ × category cell.
- Produce a second version of Table A showing estimated FTE loss by cell, with row/column totals.

### Step 3 – Build Table B (Industry × Job Zone)
- Start from `Top10_Industry_List.csv` workforce counts.
- Allocate each industry’s CT_FTEs into Job Zones using distribution from `CT FTE counts by SOC v2.csv`.
- Build an 11 × 5 matrix (10 industries + Other × Job Zones).
- Add row totals (industry totals, matches Top10_Industry_List.csv) and column totals (Job Zone totals, matches SOC file).

### Step 4 – Extrapolate Analyzer Losses Across Table B
- Apply Analyzer v4 workflow FTE loss % to Table B, proportionally to FTE distribution.
- Produce a second version of Table B showing estimated FTE loss by industry × Job Zone.
- Row and column totals must match the statewide workflow extrapolation.

## Outputs
1. **Table A – Workforce by Job Zone × Cognitive/Routine**  
   - Raw FTEs  
   - FTE losses (Analyzer extrapolated)  

2. **Table B – Workforce by Industry × Job Zone**  
   - Raw FTEs  
   - FTE losses (Analyzer extrapolated)  

3. Both tables must include:  
   - Row totals  
   - Column totals  
   - Grand totals

## Reference Files Required
- `data/CT FTE counts by SOC v2.csv`  
- `data/Top10_Industry_List.csv`  
(No incremental references required.)
