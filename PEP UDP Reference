# Analyzer Reference: PEP vs. UDP vs. Hybrid

## 1. Technology Lineage
- **PEP (Prediction Exception Processing):** Older lineage. Predictive analytics, anomaly detection, exception flagging. Mature adoption since early 2000s.
- **UDP (Unstructured Data Processing):** Newer. LLM/deep learning enabled scaling after ~2018. Focus on unstructured document parsing and synthesis.
- **Hybrid:** Combines PEP and UDP. Delivers highest ROI in workflows where structured prediction and unstructured understanding reinforce each other.

## 2. Capability Mapping

### PEP AI Capabilities
- Monitoring: Model drift detection, retraining triggers.
- Predicting: Forecast probable outcomes from new data.
- Classifying: Pattern and rule generation for decision-making.
- Explaining: Transparent, data-supported recommendations.
- Use Case Examples: Exception handling, KYC review, fund admin validation, anomaly detection in billing.

### UDP AI Capabilities
- Summarizing: Condense single or multiple documents.
- Reasoning: Compare and contrast meaning or structure.
- Grouping: Cluster or categorize text data.
- Extracting: Pull structured content from unstructured inputs.
- Use Case Examples: Contract standardization, fund onboarding, EHR parsing, regulatory filings.

## 3. Adoption & ROI Horizon

| Use Case Type | 2022 (Today – 3 yrs) | 2026–28 (1–3 yrs) | 2029–32 (4–7 yrs) | 2033–35 (8–10 yrs) |
|---------------|-----------------------|------------------|------------------|--------------------|
| 100% PEP      | Mature; ROI 20–40%    | ROI 30–50%       | ROI 40–55%       | ROI 50–60% (plateau) |
| 100% UDP      | Pilots; ROI 10–20%    | ROI 30–50%       | ROI 50–70%       | ROI 60–80% (mainstream) |
| Hybrid (PEP+UDP) | Early pilots; ROI 20–30% | ROI 50–65%  | ROI 60–80%       | ROI 70–90% (transformational) |

## 4. Evidence of ROI in Practice
- Healthcare claims (PEP+UDP): Costs drop from ~$152 to ~$54 per claim; 64% savings; 60–80% effort reduction.
- Appeals workflows: Provider costs drop $30–75 → $8–21; Payer costs $20–45 → $6–15.
- Strategic benefits: Fewer denials, faster cash flow, scalable volume handling, audit-ready compliance.

## 5. Hybrid Use Cases – Clarification
There are two distinct Hybrid categories:

- **Mutually Dependent Hybrid**
  - PEP and UDP are inseparable for the workflow step.
  - Removing one breaks functionality.
  - Example: Healthcare claims repair → UDP extracts codes, PEP predicts denials. Both required.
- **Independent Choice Hybrid**
  - PEP and UDP can operate independently.
  - Workflow ROI increases if both are applied together.
  - Example: Contract management → UDP standardizes terms, PEP predicts compliance risk. Each works alone, but combined value is higher.

### Analyzer Guidance
- Always tag Hybrid subtasks as **Mutually Dependent** or **Independent Choice**.
- Mutually Dependent: Mandatory dual-AI classification in ROI and AI impact timelines.
- Independent Choice: Record both standalone ROI and uplift from combined use.

## 6. Implications for Analyzer
- Always classify subtasks as PEP, UDP, or Hybrid (with dependency flag).
- Hybrid is not an “edge case” but often the dominant long-term pattern.
- ROI timelines should reflect adoption curve differences between PEP, UDP, and Hybrid.
- Narratives must highlight synergy: UDP structures unstructured inputs; PEP predicts/explains outcomes. Combined use compounds savings and shifts human labor to oversight.
